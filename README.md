# Multi-Persona Software Project Creation from Natural Language Using Large Language Models

This project enables **automated software project creation** from natural language input using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. It leverages multiple simulated personas â€” such as a **Product Manager**, **System Architect**, and **Software Engineer** â€” to break down user input into detailed project documentation, design, tasks, and code.
